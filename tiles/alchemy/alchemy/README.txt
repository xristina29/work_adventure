A collection of alchemical apparatus, in the style of the Liberated Pixel Cup. 

Flasks, beakers, test tubes, funnels, condensers, calciners, pulverizers, mixers, centrifuges, furnaces, and bunsen burners. Glass, copper, and metal pipes. Lots of gears. 

This set is designed for a ton of flexibility, so may not be most appropriate if you just want to litter some alchemical decorations in a scene. Consider building a smaller set from these pieces, or using [my LPC containers set](https://opengameart.org/content/lpc-containers) instead.

Pink tiles are reserved for future animations. 

NOTE: dark-wood.png is from "[LPC] Wooden Furniture" <https://opengameart.org/content/lpc-wooden-furniture> and is NOT included in this set. Please credit separately!!

Usage: See alchemy.preview.tmx, which includes lots of examples and shows how to use most elements of the set. A few general remarks:

- Designed for use on a 16x16px grid. If using Tiled, use alchemy.tsx in most cases. alchemy-32.tsx is included to encode some animations more simply. See alchemy.preview.tmx for examples
- Layer adapters on top of devices to allow devices to be connected by glass or copper pipes. 
- You may need more than the indicated number of layers
